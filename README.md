## What I Do

I engineer robust trading systems and strategies that deliver results in volatile markets. My expertise spans:

- **Algorithmic Trading**: Building HFT, scalping, and arbitrage strategies using Python (NumPy, Pandas, Ta-Lib), MQL4 (MetaTrader), and C++ for low-latency execution.
- **Market Microstructure**: Optimizing liquidity provision, reducing slippage, and enhancing execution through advanced order flow analysis and market-making algorithms.
- **Risk Management**: Designing VaR-based frameworks, stress testing, and position-sizing algorithms to ensure portfolio resilience.
- **Blockchain & DeFi**: Developing hybrid DEX/CEX architectures and optimizing vAMM perpetual contract protocols for efficiency and security.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Using tools like Tableau, Bloomberg Terminal, and TradingView to analyze market trends and inform strategic decisions.
